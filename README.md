# ESP32_GetSolaxRealtimeData

I currently have a Solax Solar System, with a LiPo battery providing sufficient capacity to provide 1Kw of power for an hour when fully charged. So it seemed to make sense that should be able to monitor the sun, the battery and turn devices on to use the spare capacity.

This project collects data from my Solax Solar System
